# Quasiseparable matrices in JAX

A project to extend the [celerite](celerite) Gaussian Process method by building
on the literature studying "quasiseparable plus diagonal" matrices. An intro can
be found in [Matrix Computations and Semiseparable Matrices: Linear
Systems][text] (I got it from the NY public library), and so far the algorithms
are mostly based on [Eidelman & Gohberg (1999)][new-class] and [Foreman-Mackey
et al. (2017)][celerite]. An interesting reference to consider for potentially
more efficient algorithms is [Pernet & Storjohann (2018)][efficient].
